# Product_Management_Application

The Product Management application is a fundamental tool designed to facilitate comprehensive management of product information. Its core functionality includes the ability for users to add, update, view, and delete product details such as price, description, and other relevant attributes, essential for effective product recognition and management.

Developed using Spring MVC and the Spring Framework, with a MySQL database backend, this application provides a robust platform for understanding and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project serves as a practical example of applying these core functionalities within a real-world context, offering a solid foundation for further exploration and development of more complex systems.
